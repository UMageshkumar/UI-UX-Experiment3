#  Heuristic Evaluation and UX Improvement

## AIM

To perform a heuristic evaluation of existing websites or apps, identify usability issues, implement design improvements, and measure their effectiveness using A/B testing techniques to understand the impact on user experience.

## ALGORITHM

### Step 1: Select Target Apps/Websites
- Choose 2–3 competing apps or websites from the same domain (e.g., food delivery apps, e-commerce sites).
- Ensure each offers similar functionalities for fair comparison.

### Step 2: Perform Heuristic Evaluation
- Evaluate each app/website using Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics:
  - Visibility of system status
  - Match between system and real world

### Step 3: Compare UX of Apps/Websites
- Create a comparison table outlining strengths and weaknesses of each product based on the heuristic review.
- Highlight specific UX pain points and good design practices found.

### Step 4: Redesign & Apply Required Changes
- Select one app/website for improvement.
- Apply changes such as better navigation, improved layout, consistent UI elements, clearer labels, etc.

### Step 5: Conduct A/B Testing
- Simulate or conduct usability testing with a small user group or through prototyping tools.
- Collect feedback based on metrics such as task completion rate, satisfaction score, and time on task.

## RESULT
Successfully identified and analyzed usability issues in competing apps/websites using heuristic evaluation. Redesigned one interface with targeted improvements and evaluated its impact using A/B testing. The enhanced version (B) showed noticeable improvements in user satisfaction, task efficiency, and overall usability, validating the importance of systematic UX evaluation and user-centered redesign.
